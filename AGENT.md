# AI Agent Rules (Read Me First)

Goal: Improve/repair the app without breaking it.

Do NOT:
- delete files unless clearly unused
- change prisma schema without explaining why
- remove API routes
- change env variable names without listing them

Do:
- fix build errors
- fix TypeScript errors
- clean UI bugs
- improve reliability
- add clear notes in README about how to run

Always:
- keep changes small and testable
- describe what changed and why
